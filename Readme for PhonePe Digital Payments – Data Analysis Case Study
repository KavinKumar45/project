PhonePe Digital Payments – Data Analysis Case Study

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of digital payment trends in India using data inspired by PhonePe Pulse. 
The goal is to understand transaction behaviour, identify growth patterns, and derive key insights using Python-based analytics. 🚀

Project Overview:
In this case study, I performed data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis on India's digital payments landscape. 

The notebook includes:
                      ✔ Data ingestion & preprocessing
                      ✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
                      ✔ Trend analysis: Transactions, user growth & geography-wise performance
                      ✔ Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
                      ✔ Insights and recommendations based on real-world digital payment patterns

🧰 Technologies Used:
                     • Python 3
                     • Pandas – Data manipulation
                     • NumPy – Numerical operations  
                     • Matplotlib / Seaborn – Visualizations
                     • Jupyter Notebook
